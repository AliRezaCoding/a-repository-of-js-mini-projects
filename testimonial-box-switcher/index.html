                I've worked with literally hundreds of HTML/CSS developers and I
                have to say the top spot goes to this guy. This guy is an
                amazing developer. He stresses on good, clean code and pays heed
                to the details. I love developers who respect each and every
                aspect of a throughly thought out design and do their best to
                put it in code. He goes over and beyond and transforms ART into
                PIXELS - without a glitch, every time.
